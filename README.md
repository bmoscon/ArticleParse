ArticleParse
============


Library that supports HTML parsing and heuristic analysis of code to determine the "main" parts of the website. Specifically it is useful for removing boilerplate code from news articles and returning the actual text of the article.

Currently uses for analysis:

Section Length
Section Position
Number of Anchors in a Section
Anchor Density in a Section
Word Count
Uppercase Word Count
Average Word Length
Average Sentence Length
Number of Sentences

This is a work in progress. I have manually tested it on several news websites, but extensive testing still needs to be performed.

Supports Python3
