ArticleParse
============


Library that supports HTML parsing and heuristic analysis of code to determine the "main" parts of the website. Specifically it is useful for removing boilerplate code from news articles and returning the actual text of the article.


This is a work in progress. I have manually tested it on several news websites, but extensive testing still needs to be performed. I have also, for the time being, hardcoded a lot of the metrics it uses to classify a section of the site as relevant.
